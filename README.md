Greetings and welcome to `hello-rust `. This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

Alternatively, for a first-time Rust learner, there are several other resources:

- [The Book](https://doc.oudream.org/book/index.html) - The most comprehensive resource for learning Rust, but a bit theoretical sometimes. You will be using this along with hello-rust !
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.oudream.org/rust-by-example/index.html) - Learn Rust by solving little exercises! It's almost like `hello-rust `, but online

## Getting Started

_Note: If you're on MacOS, make sure you've installed Xcode and its developer tools by typing `xcode-select --install`._
_Note: If you're on Linux, make sure you've installed gcc. Deb: `sudo apt install gcc`. Yum: `sudo yum -y install gcc`._

You will need to have Rust installed. You can get it by visiting <https://rustup.rs>. This'll also install Cargo, Rust's package/project manager.
